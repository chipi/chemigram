# Changelog

All notable changes to Chemigram will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
per ADR-041.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `chemigram.core.xmp.synthesize_xmp` — XMP synthesizer (Slice 1, Issue #3).
  Path A only (SET-replace by `(operation, multi_priority)`; last-writer-wins on
  input order; preserves baseline `num` and `iop_order`). Path B raises
  `NotImplementedError` until RFC-001's iop_order question resolves. Closes
  **RFC-001** (parser/synthesizer API → ADR-050) and **RFC-006** (same-module
  collision → ADR-051). 10 unit tests + 1 integration test against real Phase 0
  fixtures.
- `chemigram.core.xmp` — parser + writer for darktable XMP sidecars (Slice 1, Issue #2).
  Public API: `parse_xmp`, `write_xmp`, `Xmp`, `HistoryEntry`, `XmpParseError`.
  Round-trip property (semantic equality) verified against the v3 Phase 0 reference
  (11-entry history with mixed user-authored and `_builtin_*` entries) plus minimal,
  single-entry, and unknown-field fixtures. `iop_order` modeled `Optional[int]` per
  Phase 0 finding (absent in dt 5.4.1 XMPs).
- `chemigram.core.dtstyle` — parser for darktable `.dtstyle` files (Slice 1, Issue #1).
  Public API: `parse_dtstyle`, `DtstyleEntry`, `PluginEntry`, `DtstyleParseError`.
  Calibrated to darktable 5.4.1; opaque blob preservation per ADR-008; user-entry
  identity via empty `<multi_name>` per ADR-010. Uses `defusedxml`.
- Slice 1 prep: `tests/fixtures/{dtstyles,xmps}/` with Phase 0 artifacts;
  hand-stitched `multi_module_synthetic.dtstyle`; `make ci` target mirroring
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; smoke tests in `tests/unit/` and `tests/integration/`.
- Phase 2 doc system: PRDs, RFCs, ADRs, reference docs (TA, PA), templates, indexes
- ROADMAP/IMPLEMENTATION plan with slice-by-slice closure-as-gate mapping
- Initial CLAUDE.md operational handbook
- Python project conventions locked via 9 ADRs (ADR-034 through ADR-042)
- Bootstrap project scaffolding (pyproject.toml, pre-commit, CI, release scripts)

### Status

Pre-Phase 1. No published releases yet. The `0.0.x` versions are scaffolding;
the first publishable release will be `0.1.0` at the close of Phase 1 Slice 1.
